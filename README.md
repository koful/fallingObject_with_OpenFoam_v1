# fallingObject_with_OpenFoam_v1
This is my first github upload. You can reach me via turanazim@gmail.com
Original work: https://publications.sckcen.be/portal/files/4545077/Six_degrees_of_freedom_modelisation_of_an_object_in_a_fluid_with_OpenFOAM_Rapport.pdf
Running the main run file run_2d.sh is sufficient.
Geoemtry added with topoSet. 
I also did the same work with SnappyHexMesh. I will upload that project too.
